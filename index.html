								<p style="font-size:16px">I enrolled in this course so that I can switch career paths. I am currently working in the project management field, but my passion has always been with anything to do with compueters. My love of computers started around the age of 10, when I began helping my dad build computers. A few years later, I was setting up our LAN network and dipping my toes in the water for HTML design. There were a few times that I completely formatted my computer and reinstalled Windows just for the fun of it. Between you and I, I definitely did this more than what was good for the computers, and I definitely created too many partitions the first few times.</p>

									<p style="font-size:14px"> Below the 'Projects' link, there is an 'Contact Info' link that will take you to the page with my LinkedIn profile as well as my GitHub username. There is an email link, but it is dead for now as I have not yet set up an email address that I can dedicate solely to you and this portfolio. I plan to include that in the future.

									<p style="font-size:14px"> Thank you for visiting my portfolio. It is a little rough around the edges. My goal is to continue to refine this portfolio; everything from the layout to the color scheme. I am also planning on expanding my project list, as well as swapping out some of the existing projects for projects I create outside of the Full Stack Development course. I have a few ideas that have been placed on the backburner that I would love to finally begin.
